# Legacy_Employee_Database_Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing the legacy employee data of Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, during the 1980s and 1990s. The goal is to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis on the available data from six CSV files.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into three main parts:

## Part 1: Data Modelling
Inspected the CSV files and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using QuickDBD.

## Part 2: Data Engineering
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
## Part 3: Data Analysis
Performed various SQL queries to answer questions about the data, such as employee details, hire dates, managers, department information, and frequency counts of employee last names.
Requirements
Data Modelling: ERD or table schemas
Data Engineering: Table definitions, column data types, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and table relationships
Data Analysis: SQL queries for various data analysis tasks
## Deployment
The project is deployed to a GitHub repository, including the necessary files for data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Acknowledgements
The data used in this project was generated by Mockaroo, LLC (2022), a realistic data generator.
